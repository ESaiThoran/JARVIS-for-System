"I am actively developing and enhancing a Python-based project named Jarvis, a voice-interactive system designed to perform user-initiated tasks on PCs. This includes managing schedules, executing browser-related operations, fetching real-time data, and handling application and website tasks. With integrated large language model (LLM) capabilities, the assistant delivers natural and context-aware interactions. The project is a work in progress, and I am continuously adding new features, improving its responsiveness, and expanding its functionality to make it even more versatile and user-friendly."
