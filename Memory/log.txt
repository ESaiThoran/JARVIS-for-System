You : jarvis provide exit program 
jarvis : To implement an "exit" command for Jarvis, we need to add a function that handles this specific instruction. Here's how we can modify the existing code to include an exit functionality:

```python
def handle_exit():
    print("Exiting Jarvis...")
    sys.exit(0)

# Add this function call to the main loop
while True:
    # ... (existing code)
    
    elif command == "exit":
        handle_exit()
```

This modification adds a `handle_exit()` function that prints a message and exits the program when called. We then add an "elif" condition to check for the "exit" command and call this function if it matches.

Make sure to import the `sys` module at the beginning of your script:

```python
import sys
```

With these changes, users can now type "exit" to terminate the Jarvis program. Remember to test thoroughly to ensure the exit functionality works as expected alongside other commands.

You : jarvis give me a code to handle exit function
jarvis : Certainly! I'll provide you with a Python code snippet that demonstrates how to handle the `exit` function. This example will show you how to catch and process the `SystemExit` exception when the program exits.

```python
import sys

def handle_exit():
    print("Exiting program...")
    # Perform any cleanup operations here
    # For example, save data, close files, etc.

try:
    # Your main program code goes here
    while True:
        user_input = input("Enter 'exit' to quit: ")
        if user_input.lower() == 'exit':
            raise SystemExit()
except SystemExit as e:
    handle_exit()
finally:
    print("Program execution completed.")
```

In this code:

1. We define a `handle_exit()` function that performs any necessary cleanup operations before exiting.

2. The main part of the program runs in a loop, prompting the user for input.

3. If the user enters 'exit', we raise a `SystemExit` exception.

4. The `except` block catches the `SystemExit` exception and calls our `handle_exit()` function.

5. The `finally` block ensures that some final actions (like printing "Program execution completed.") always occur, even if an exception was raised.

To use this code:

1. Save it to a file, e.g., `exit_handler.py`.
2. Run the script using Python: `python exit_handler.py`.

When you run the program and enter 'exit', it will call the `handle_exit()` function before completing its execution.

Remember to replace the placeholder cleanup operations in `handle_exit()` with your actual requirements. This could include saving data, closing files, releasing resources, or performing any other necessary cleanup tasks before your program exits.
You : jarvis give me a python code to print prime numbers
jarvis : Certainly! Here's a Python code to print prime numbers:

```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

# Print first 50 prime numbers
count = 0
num = 2
while count < 50:
    if is_prime(num):
        print(num)
        count += 1
    num += 1
```

This code defines a function `is_prime()` to check if a number is prime, then uses a loop to print the first 50 prime numbers. The `is_prime()` function checks divisibility up to the square root of the number for efficiency.

To run this code, save it as a .py file (e.g., `prime_numbers.py`) and execute it using Python.

You : jarvis
jarvis : @web_search "jarvis voice recognition technology"Here's a tutorial on integrating voice recognition technology into a JARVIS-like AI assistant using Python:

### Step 1: Set up the environment

First, you'll need to install the necessary libraries:

```
pip install pyttsx3 SpeechRecognition pyaudio
```

### Step 2: Initialize speech modules

```python
import pyttsx3
from speech_recognition import Microphone
import speech_recognition as sr
import time

# Initialize speech engine
engine = pyttsx3.init()

def speak(text):
    engine.say(text)
    engine.runAndWait()
```

This sets up the speech synthesis and recognition modules [0].

### Step 3: Implement speech recognition

```python
def listen():
    r = sr.Recognizer()
    with Microphone() as source:
        print("Listening...")
        audio = r.listen(source)
    
    try:
        print("Recognizing...")
        text = r.recognize_google(audio)
        print(f"You said: {text}")
        return text.lower()
    except:
        print("Sorry, I didn't catch that.")
        return ""
```

This function listens for input and converts it to text [0].

### Step 4: Create basic commands

```python
def take_command():
    while True:
        command = listen()
        if command == "hello":
            speak("Hello! How can I help you?")
        elif command == "bye":
            speak("Goodbye!")
            break
        else:
            speak("I didn't understand that command.")
```

This creates a simple command structure for basic interactions [0].

### Step 5: Put it all together

```python
def main():
    speak("Welcome! I'm JARVIS.")
    take_command()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This runs the entire program [0].

### Key points to consider:

1. Error handling: Implement try-except blocks to handle speech recognition errors gracefully.
2. Natural language processing: For more advanced interactions, consider integrating NLP libraries like NLTK or spaCy.
3. Task automation: Expand JARVIS's capabilities by integrating with system commands and third-party APIs.
4. Voice customization: Allow users to choose different voices or accents for JARVIS.

### Best practices:

1. Use environment variables for sensitive information like API keys.
2. Implement logging for debugging and monitoring.
3. Consider using a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
4. Add user feedback mechanisms to improve interaction flow.

This tutorial provides a basic framework for creating a JARVIS-like AI assistant using voice recognition technology. You can expand on this foundation to create a more sophisticated and personalized AI companion.
